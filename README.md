Added column after both functions 
We can't use == for assigning value
num_str == str(n)
num_digits == len(num_str)
Changed it to 
num_str = str(n)
num_digits = len(num_str)
Changed * to ** for exponentiation 
Added a , between two arguments start and end of function 
Added column after for loop in that function 

if is_narcissistic(num)
Function name is incorrect 
Changed it to
if is_narc(num)

Incorrect Function Call at the End
Changed it to print_narcis_numbers(1000, 5000)
